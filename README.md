Just Another Text Editor that allows for creating and updating text data and store it locally

## Description

This application allows the user to create, edit, change and delete data on the fly using their browser, or installing it locally as a PWA (Progressive Web Application). It is a very lightweight application and can now be used on and off internet. Simply build it, start it and then install it using your browser and now you will have a functioning PWA you can use to take notes, write a paper, or whatever you want. 

Some specific technologies this application uses are: webpack, HMR (Hot Module Replacement), IndexedDB and Babel as the core technologies. Here is what it will look like in browswer (or pretty much the same as an installed app):

## Motivation for this application

As a person that is busy and on the move, I would like something lightweight and easy to use either on my phone or home computer so I can take notes or write a dictation or just thoughts. This application will gives that to you.



### Just to see how it will look using Insomnia, here is a snippet of all users:
